# Test Case Generation

We have introduced a new generation package into the application in order to explore options for generating test cases.

The test case generation is initially targeted at open api endpoint test cases that result from an analysis of the discovery input files.

Test case generation stems from information collected via the discovery model and typically submitted via the application UI.
